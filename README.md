<h3>Hi, Nice to meet you 👋</h3>

<h3>I'm Rafie Aliefa Khana Kotjek,</h3>
<h4>but you can call me Rafie</h4>

<p>I'm a junior front-end developer. I can use HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React JS and have experience with frameworks such as Material UI and CSS extensions like Sass. I decided to be a front-end developer because I'm interested in tech and like designing pages, so I started to pursue my career as a front-end developer.</p>

<h4>About me:</h4>

- 👀 I’m interested in tech and programming
- 🌱 I'm currently learning to be a front-end developer at Glints Academy
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate and become more participatory in the community
- 📫 You can reach me by email at rafiekhana@gmail.com
